* Remember to take ten minutes to submit your online exam. There is a submission
  window (12:30 - 12:40), but if you finish the exam before, you can submit it
  as you did when submitting regular assignments ahead of time.

* The maximum amount of points you can score on the exam: 60 points. The grade for the
  exam is as follows:
  - Chalmers students:
    * 3: 24 - 35 points
    * 4: 36 - 47 points
    * 5: 48 - 60 points
  - GU students:
    * Godkänd: 24-47 points
    * Väl godkänd: 48-60 points
  - PhD student: 36 points to pass.

* Results will be available within 21 days from the exam date.

* Notes:

  - Read through the exam first and plan your time.
  - Answers preferably in English, some assistants might not read Swedish.
  - If a question does not give you all the details you need, you may make reasonable
    assumptions. Your assumptions must be clearly stated. If your solution only works
    under certain conditions, state them.
  - *As a recommendation*, consider spending around 1h 20 minutes per
    exercise. However, this is only a recommendation.
  - To see your exam: by appointment (*send email to Alejandro Russo*)

Preliminaries about this online exam
======

<div class="alert alert-info">
  Below you find the information that is related to **the online exam**
</div>

* Please note that this is an exam to be carried out individually, and since
  this is an exam from home, we will be very strict with plagiarism.

* This exam considers that you will have open books as well as Internet access,
  i.e., access to the course's content and code,
  [Hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org/), etc. -- and you can use all of such
  resources!

* The exam consists on *programming exercises* and *multiple questions*.
  - You will get a source code skeleton for each coding exercise that you need
  to complete.
  - Each question is to be answered as a comment in your source code. There are
  specific places in the source code indicating where to write your answer.

* The exam is designed to **not need any special Haskell package**. It is
  enough to use the ones imported by each source file.

What and how to submit
======

* You should submit the code skeleton **completed with your solution and
  answers**. The code skeleton can be found below.

  <table class="table table-bordered">
  <tr>
    <td class="success">Code skeleton (Check Files tab)</td>
    <td class="alert-info">mocked-exam-0.1.0.0.tar.gz</td>
  </tr>
  </table>

* Before you submit your code, please clean it up! We will use the same
  requirements for clean code as in the course's assignments, that is, clean code
  - does not have long (> 80 characters) lines
  - has a consistent layout
  - has type signatures for all top-level functions
  - has good comments for all modules, functions, data types and instances.
  - has no junk (junk is unused code, code which is commented out, unnecessary comments)
  - has no overly complicated function definitions
  - does not contain any repetitive code (copy-and-paste programming)

* **Use `cabal sdist` to generate the source tarball that you will submit**. Make
  sure the tarball is working by extracting it in another directory and running
  `cabal configure` and `cabal build` and checking that everything looks right.

* **In addition, submit the files `Ex1.hs`, `Ex2.hs`, and `Ex3.hs` with your
  solutions and answers in Canvas and make sure that they are not part of any
  directory/folder**, i.e., we want just plain `.hs` files. This helps us to grade
  your submission fast since Canvas does not understand `.tar.gz` files.


Exercise 1 (20 points)
===========

File `src/Exam/Ex1.hs`

Task 1 (10 pts)
------

1. Implement the function

   ```haskell
   freverse :: [a] -> [a]
   ```

   which simply implements `reverse` using `foldr`.

   ```haskell
   foldr :: Foldable t => (a -> b -> b) -> b -> t a -> b
   ```

2. Question: Is `freverse` faster than Haskell `reverse`? Justify your answer.


Task 2 (10 pts)
------

Write a Quick Check property that test that your function, `freverse` behaves
the same as Haskell's `reverse`.


Exercise 2 (20 points)
===============

File `src/Exam/Ex2.hs`

This exercise is based on the module *Type-based modeling* of the course. If you
do not remember it, do not worry, we will briefly recap it here.
[In any case, the content of the lecture is
available.](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2017/course/TDA342_Advanced_Functional_Programming/lecture13.html)

We consider a simple (non-monadic) DSL for integers and booleans
expressions. The DSL gets implemented in a deep-embedded manner.

```haskell
data Expr where
  -- Constructors
  LitI   :: Int  -> Expr
  LitB   :: Bool -> Expr
  -- Combinators
  (:+:)  :: Expr -> Expr -> Expr
  (:==:) :: Expr -> Expr -> Expr
  If     :: Expr -> Expr -> Expr -> Expr
```

and the run function, which is the most interesting piece of the code:

```haskell
eval :: Expr -> Value
```

Since expressions can be reduced to integers or booleans, an element of type
`Value` is either an integer or a boolean.

```haskell
data Value = VInt Int | VBool Bool
```

There are some aspects of this implementation that we need to remark.

1. This DSL allows to evaluate ill-typed expressions, so calling `eval` can fail
  miserably but we do not worry about that here.

  ```haskell
  > eval (LitB True :==: LitI 42)
  *** Exception: Crash!
  ```

2. You can inspect the *type of values* as follows.

  ```haskell
  > showTypeOfVal (eval (LitI 42))
  "Int"
  > showTypeOfVal (eval (LitB True :==: LitB False))
  "Bool"
  ```

3. You can also nicely print objects of the EDSL as follows.

  ```haskell
  > show  $ If (LitB False) (LitI 2) (LitI 2 :+: LitI 1736)
  "if False then 2 else 2 + 1736"
  ```
4. You can *randomly* generate terms of type `Expr` as follows.

   ```haskell
   > import Test.QuickCheck
   > generate (arbitrary :: Gen Expr)
   if (if True + True then if -22 then False else False else -8 + -20) == True
   then 16 else -13 == (False == -6) + 4 + (if False then -19 else True)
   ```

   The output that you get when running `generate (arbitrary :: Gen Expr)`
   surely varies due to the randomness used by QuickCheck.

In this exercise, your goal is to extend the EDSL to work with lists. So, we
extend the EDSL with two new constructors (`Nil` and `Cons`) as follows.

```haskell
data Expr where
  LitI   :: Int  -> Expr
  LitB   :: Bool -> Expr
  (:+:)  :: Expr -> Expr -> Expr
  (:==:) :: Expr -> Expr -> Expr
  If     :: Expr -> Expr -> Expr -> Expr
  Nil    :: Expr                         -- new
  Cons   :: Expr -> Expr -> Expr         -- new
```

To help you out along the way, we have include many test cases (definitions
`test1`, `test2`, .., `test11`).

Task 2.1 (5 pts)
------

Extend the pretty printing of the language, i.e., definition of `showsPrec`, to
consider lists. For instance, your solution should produce the following
outputs.

```haskell
> let test1 = Nil in show test1  -- def. test1
"[]"
> let test2 = Cons (LitI 1) (Cons (LitB True) Nil) in show test2
"[1,True]"
> let test3 = Cons (LitI 1) (Cons (LitB True) (Cons (LitI 42) Nil)) in show test3
"[1,True,42]"
> show test6 -- see def. test6
"[[1,True],[1,True,42]]"
```

It is Ok for your function to crash when the list is ill-formed.

```haskell
> show $ Cons (LitI 42) (LitB True)
"[*** Exception: The list got broken
```

Task 2.2 (5 pts)
-----

Extend `arbExpr :: Int -> Gen Expr` to generate also lists.
- Make sure that you do not generate empty lists.
- Keep in mind that your extension to `arbExpr` very often will generate
  ill-typed terms like `Cons (LitI 42) (LitB True)` and it is Ok!

  ```haskell
  > generate (arbitrary :: Gen Expr)
  [-29]
  > generate (arbitrary :: Gen Expr)
  (if if True then -18 else [(if if [*** Exception: The list got broken
  ```

Do not worry much about these two points. We will clarify them later on.

Task 2.3 (10 pts)
----

Extend the definition of `Value` and `eval` to consider lists.
- Comparison between lists is `True` **only**  when both lists have
the same length and the elements are equal point-wise.
  ```haskell
  > show test5
  "[1,True] == [1,True,42]"
  > eval test5
  VBool False
  > show test7
  "[[1,True],[1,True,42]] == [[1,True],[1,True,42]]"
  > eval test7
  VBool True
  ```
- Addition between lists is *only* defined  when  both lists contain numbers. The
addition is performed point-wise.
  ```haskell
  > show test8
  "[1,2]"
  > show test9
  "[100,1]"
  > show test10
  "[1,2] + [100,1]"
  > eval test10 -- it should result in a value list [101,3]
  ...
  > show test11
  "[[1,2]] + [[100,1]]"
  > eval test11 -- it fails since it is adding a list of lists
  *** Exception: Problems adding lists!
  ```

Task 2.4 (2 pts)
----

Extend function `showTypeOfEval` to display `[Value]` when dealing with
expressions which evaluate to lists.

```haskell
> show test2
"[1,True]"
> showTypeOfVal (eval test2)
"[Value]"
> show test6
"[[1,True],[1,True,42]]"
> showTypeOfVal (eval test6)
"[Value]"
```

Exercise 3 (20 points)
======

File `src/Exam/Ex3.hs`

Task 1
------

1. Give the instance `Monad` for `X` as the identify monad.

2. Can you give instances for `Applicative` and `Functor` using the methods from
`Monad`? Justify your answer.
