    As previous years, you may bring up to two pages (on one A4 sheet of paper) of
    pre-written notes - a “summary sheet”. These notes may be typed or
    handwritten. They may be from any source. If this summary sheet is brought to
    the exam it must also be handed in with the exam (so make a copy if you want to
    keep it).

    You will also get an appendix with some standard definitions in the exam. So,
    you don't need to use your notes for that. Please, see how the appendix looks in
    a previous exam.
