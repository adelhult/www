  <div class = "alert alert-info">
    I got some (valid) concerns that to get a 4 or 5 in Part I of the
    second lab (deadline yesterday), you need some of the content
    that I finished today. However, that does not mean you won't get
    it. You are encouraged to resubmit to increase your grade!
    Sometimes, lectures take more than I planned (sorry). In short,
    don't worry, re-submit later to get your 4 or 5.
