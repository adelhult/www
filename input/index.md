# Welcome!

  * Web page for the Concurrent Programming Course (TDA382/DIT390)
  * Period 1 school year 2015-2016.


# News!

* 15 October

<div class="alert alert-info"> On Monday (**19th of October**), the lecture is
going to be about solving past exams.
</div>


* 13 October

<div class="alert alert-info"> ATTENTION GU STUDENTS: the information about how
we determine the final grade of the course **was out of date**. To get VG as the
grade for the course, you need to score at least 80% of the points when
considering the exam + labs. In this way, you are in a similar position as
Chalmers students, where you can count the lab points towards your final grade.
</div>


* 12nd October

<div class="alert alert-info">
Lecture on Thursday 15th October! (by Spotify)<br>

The (guest) lecture on Thursday will start at **8.45 and it will finish a bit before 10**.
So, you don't need to come so early at Chalmers.
