* Feb 12th

  <div class = "alert alert-info"> I got some (valid) concerns that to get a 4
     or 5 in Part I of the second lab, you need some of the content that I
     finished today. However, that does not mean you won't get it. You are
     encouraged to resubmit to increase your grade! Sometimes, lectures take
     more than I planned. In short, don't worry, re-submit later to get your 4
     or 5.  </div>
