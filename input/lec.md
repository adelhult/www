We will try to have the lecture notes available on-line before the lecture so
you can bring them to the lecture to do notes and (in case of errors)
corrections. However, *it might not happen* since there are some changes for
this year. For impatient students, you could check last [year's web
page](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/course/afp/).

## 1. [Introduction to the course](./lecture1.html).

* **Topics**: The goal of the course. Course Materials. Organization. Evaluation
  orders. Lazyness. Type classes.

* **Reading**: Chapters 1-6, Chapters 8-10 (mostly
repetition of what you have seen in Introduction to Functional Programming at
Chalmers). Note that it is ~200 pages, so start reading now if you need an
update!

* [Source code](https://bitbucket.org/russo/afp-code/src/1f5af2807b33b925059be1380ffe7e1049fbb9cb/L1/?at=master)

* **Optional reading**:
  - Applicative Functors are introduced in Real World Haskell Chapter 10, used
    more later in the same book Chapter 16.
  - Haskell -- The Craft of Functional Programming: Chapter 12 on overloading, Chapter 16 on
    abstract types, and Chapter 17 on laziness.
  - The Haskell School of Expression: Chapter 12 on type classes, Chapter 14 on
    streams, Section 18.1 on higher-order types.

## 2. [Domain Specific Embedded Languages (EDSL)](./lecture2.html).

* **Topics**:

* [Source code](https://bitbucket.org/russo/afp-code/src/1f5af2807b33b925059be1380ffe7e1049fbb9cb/L2/?at=master)

* **Reading**: Chapters 5 has a EDSL for pretty printing, Chapter 9 for file
searching and Chapter 13 one for arithmetic expressions.
