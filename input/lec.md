We will try to have the lecture notes available on-line before the lecture so
you can bring them to the lecture to do notes and (in case of errors)
corrections. However, *it might not happen* since there are some changes for
this year. For impatient students, you could check [last year's web
page](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2015/course/TDA342/).

## 1. [Introduction to the course](./lecture1.html).

* **Topics**: The goal of the course. Course Materials. Organization. Evaluation
  orders. Lazyness. Type classes.

* **Reading**: Chapters 1-6, Chapters 8-10 (mostly
repetition of what you have seen in Introduction to Functional Programming at
Chalmers). Note that it is ~200 pages, so start reading now if you need an
update!

* [Source code](https://bitbucket.org/russo/afp-code/src/HEAD/L1/?at=master)

* **Optional reading**:
  - Applicative Functors are introduced in Real World Haskell Chapter 10, used
    more later in the same book Chapter 16.

    concept of containers.

    and 3.

## 5. [Parser derivation](./lecture5.html)

* **Topics**: Another application of monads, namely parsing. Refinement of
    implementation by program derivation. The focus here is on learning outcome
    "Spec: use specifictaion based development techniques".

* [Source
  code](https://bitbucket.org/russo/afp-code/src/HEAD/L5/?at=master)

* **Reading**: Chapters 16, until p. 390 or so; to get a feel for what parser
    combinators are, [Parallel Parser

## 6. [Monad transformers](./lecture6.html)

* **Topics**: we learn how to build complicated monads from simple building
    blocks. We cover the reader and state monad transformers. We apply them to
    write a interpreter for simple expressions.

  code](https://bitbucket.org/russo/afp-code/src/HEAD/L6/?at=master)

* **Reading**: Chapters 18 on Monad Transformers.

* **Optional reading**:

    by Sheng Liang, Paul Hudak, and Mark Jones.

## 7. Looking forward! (February 11th)

* **Topics**: In this lecture / excercise session we will work through old AFP
    exam questions in groups to identify important topics and practice
    collaborative problem solving and discussion. This is in response to student
    comments wanting more practice of the kind of problems typically included in
    the written exams.

* **Assistants on charge**: Dan Ros√©n and Anton Ekblad

## 8. [Monad transformers II](./lecture8.html)

* **Topics**: This lecture looks into the consequences of the application order
    of `StateT` and `ExceptT` monad transformers in the interpreter. The lecture
    also shows how to create your own monad transformers -- for that, we show an
    implementation for `StateT`, `ExceptT`, and `ReaderT`.

* [Source
  code](https://bitbucket.org/russo/afp-code/src/HEAD/L8/?at=master)

* The reading material is the same as lecture 6 (see above).

## 9. [Information-flow Control in Haskell](./lecture9.md)

* **Topics**: In this lecture, we will see a use of monads for controlling
    effects in order to provide security for Haskell programs. We will focus on
    how to preserve sensitive data when executed by untrusted code, i.e., code
    written by someone else.

* [Source
  code for MAC library](https://bitbucket.org/russo/mac-lib), [Source code for
  the demo](https://bitbucket.org/russo/mac-demo)

    Haskell by A. Russo](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo/publications_files/pearl-russo.pdf)


## 14. Looking forward! (March 3rd)

* **Topics**: Second instance of the excercise session with exam questions.

## 16. Looking back! (March 10th)

* **Topics**: In this lecture we briefly look back at the learning outcomes and
    how they relate to the different parts of the course and what parts of the
    Real world Haskell book are covered. Then we go through a few examples
    chosen by popular vote by the participants.

* **Assistants on charge**: John J. Camilleri and Anton Ekblad
